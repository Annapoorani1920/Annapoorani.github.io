			Hi! My name is Annapoorani Anantharaman. I am from Chennai. I love drawing, music and am a total movie-buff. 
			<br>
			I am currently studying in IIIT-Hyderabad doing my M.E in Computer Science and Engineering. I previously studied in Chennai in Jeppiaar Engineering College.
			<br>
			My interests in Computer science lie in </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Game development using Unity and C#</li>
				<li> Programming using C++</li>
				<li> Cryptography and network security</li>
				<li> Mobile app development using android</li>
			</ul>
			<p>	I have learnt the following languages </p>
			<ul>
				<li> C++, C</li>
				<li> Shell Scripting</li>				
				<li> HTML, CSS, JS</li>
				<li> Android, Java, Python</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			<br>
			I learnt classical dance (Bharathanatyam) for many years and that opened so many doors to me.
			<br>
			 I want to learn many languages and travel to so many places. The core of life is to experience new things and I believe nothing can do that better than exploring new places and feeling the land and the sky. I think words are beautiful and those with the gift of story writing or poetry are lucky. Life is so short yet there is so much to do! 
			 <br>
			 I like playing chess, travelling, reading books, doing yoga and trying new things.

		<h1>Publication</h1>
		
		I have published two papers:
		<ol>
			<li>Paper on Almond - a chatbot using AI that assists and acts as a companion for the elderly</li>
			<p>Published in 6th international conference on science, technology, engineering and management(ICONSTEM) in <u>2020</u>. The paper was about my project, a chatbot using ai that would act as a companion. It used a multimodal interface and a simple way for interacion. It could support the elderly by voice interaction and speach recognition. It used Artificial intelligence and was developed in Android.<br>

		<h1>Education</h1>
		<p>
			My education was primarily in chennai. I had a really fun school which would prioritise extra curricular activities a lot.
			My teachers were nice and the student community was smaller, relatively. So everyone knew everyone.
			<br>
			I learnt classical dance and used to perform for our school annual day. 
			Sports were given equal importance too. I played chess and badminton (admittedly badly), and joined in the yoga club. Life was mostly play time then.
			<br>
			Then came college and books became bigger suddenly.I started learning many new things and found it fascinating how computers worked. My profound liking increased with subjects like Data Structures and algorithms, Compiler Design, Game theory and Cryptography. 
			 <br>
			 I joinedthe coding club in my college and got the chance to attend many events and seminars and contests and my exposure widened greatly. I made projects with the languages I learnt.
			 <br>
			 I had many memorable college days. New experiences in so many aspects.
			<br>

			<br>
			Now I have started yet another adventure, in the form of a masters course in a new University.
			I am excited. Despite pervasive persistent covid.
